What is Raw Data in a Cryptocurrencies Dashboard?
Raw data in a cryptocurrencies dashboard is the original,
unprocessed data collected directly from cryptocurrency sources 
before any cleaning, filtering, or visualization is done.

This data shows the actual market values of cryptocurrencies 
exactly as received from exchanges or APIs.
